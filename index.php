  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>What is this?</em></p>
This a project that we did as a part of a 1,5 month Software Developer course in the Turku University of Applied Sciences in 2019.<br>
Point of the course was to take our existing IT and coding skills and use them to develop a web based application and do both front-end and back-end ourselves
so we would have some experience with full stack development.<br>
We also learned about agile software development as the project was done using the SCRUM method.

<p class="w3-center"><em>Who are we?</em></p>
We are 4 people with very different backgrounds in IT. Some of us had prior experience with coding and some of us didn't, but every one of us learned something new
as we worked in different parts of the project.

<p class="w3-center"><em>Is the project finished?</em></p>
No.<br>
At least for now. We had less than 6 workweeks to do this and the goal was never to deliver a finished product, the goal was to learn. We have a working demo that shows
the concept of the application, but at the moment this text was written we didn't have a working demo with all the basic features we wanted to include.
